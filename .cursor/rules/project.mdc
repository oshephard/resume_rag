# Cursor Rules

## Technology Stack

- Use TypeScript for all code files
- Use yarn as the package manager (not npm or pnpm)
- When installing dependencies, use `yarn add` or `yarn add -D`

## Code Style

- Prefer self-documenting code over comments
- Split reusable workflows into their own functions for reuse and readability.

## Workflow

- Before implementing changes, plan out the steps and explain the approach
- Break down complex tasks into clear, sequential steps
- When uncertain about requirements or implementation details, ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions
- If multiple approaches are possible, present options and ask for preference before proceeding

## Communication

- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous or incomplete
- Don't assume implementation details without confirmation
- When in doubt, ask rather than guess
