# Project overview

This is an AI assistant that can help you with your resume. It can answer questions about your resume,
generate new resume data for you based on your experience, and suggest improvements/changes based on a
job posting.
Users may:

- Upload PDFs like resumes, CVs.
- Import LinkedIn posts.
- Import Certificate badges.
- Provide simple text explaining an experience they recently had.
  Then, using that data as context, the Assistant can:
- Generate new Resumes
- Answer questions about your experience
- Suggest relevant experience for job postings, interview questions, and the like

## Technology Stack

- Use TypeScript for all code files
- Use yarn as the package manager (not npm or pnpm)
- When installing dependencies, use `yarn add` or `yarn add -D`

## Code Style

- Prefer self-documenting code over comments
- Split reusable workflows into their own functions for reuse and readability.
