# Cursor Rules

## Technology Stack
- Use TypeScript for all code files
- Use yarn as the package manager (not npm or pnpm)
- When installing dependencies, use `yarn add` or `yarn add -D`

## Code Style
- Minimize comments in code - only add comments when they provide essential context or explain non-obvious logic
- Prefer self-documenting code over comments
- Avoid excessive inline comments or comment blocks

## Workflow
- Before implementing changes, plan out the steps and explain the approach
- Break down complex tasks into clear, sequential steps
- When uncertain about requirements or implementation details, ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions
- If multiple approaches are possible, present options and ask for preference before proceeding

## Communication
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous or incomplete
- Don't assume implementation details without confirmation
- When in doubt, ask rather than guess
